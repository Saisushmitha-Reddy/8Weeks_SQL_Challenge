# 8 Week SQL Challenge (MySQL) — Portfolio

This repository contains my solutions to the **8 Week SQL Challenge** case studies, implemented in **MySQL** with clear explanations of logic and execution.

## Goals
- Strengthen SQL foundations (joins, aggregations, window functions)
- Build analytical problem-solving mindset
- Practice interview-style SQL questions and edge cases
- Document reasoning and trade-offs (ties, duplicates, date logic)

## Tech Stack
- MySQL 8+
- MySQL Workbench

## Case Studies
1. Danny’s Diner ✅ (in progress)
2. Pizza Runner
3. Foodie-Fi
4. Data Bank
5. Data Mart
6. Clique Bait
7. Balanced Tree Clothing Co.
8. Fresh Segments

## Repo Structure
- `00-setup/` → environment + setup scripts
- Each case study folder includes:
  - `schema.sql` (tables + inserts)
  - `solutions.sql` (final queries)
  - `solutions.md` (explanations + outputs)

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Run the schema script for the case study (e.g., `01-dannys-diner/schema.sql`)
3. Run queries in `solutions.sql`
